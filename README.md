# KivyBluetoothApp
This is a Python-Kivy app designed to control a bluetooth RC car.
It sends a list of commands over bluetooth which are accumulated by clicking the arrows.

Hopefully it inspires you or helps you with programming your Bluetooth interface.

The Bluetooth code is all in one spot and commented.
